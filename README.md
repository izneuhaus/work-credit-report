Work Credit Report
=============

This is a web-based frontend that provides a clear and easy way to track work credit hours for a housing cooperative. The report is served directly from GitHub (via GitHub Pages) and the data is retrieved from an Airtable Base.

You can see it in action at http://izzyneuha.us/work-credit-report/.


Want to use this tool?
=============

This code is provided under the MIT license, which means you're able to use it, for free, with minimal restrictions. While there is some configuration involved before it can be used, it should mostly "just work" from that point forward with little to no maintenance required. You can find setup instructions below.

If you would like to use this system but aren't comfortable dealing with the setup process, feel free to shoot an email to contact@izzyneuha.us and I'd be happy to help for a small fee.
