# Work Credit Report

This is a web-based report that provides a clear and easy way to track work credit hours for a housing cooperative. The report is hosted directly from GitHub (via GitHub Pages) and the data is retrieved from an Airtable database. Co-op members can submit their hours via an online survey and view their personalized monthly progress anytime from a mobile-friendly dashboard view.

You can the report in action at http://izzyneuha.us/work-credit-report/ and explore the Airtable backend with example data at https://airtable.com/shrmlushhijHOP1SK.

## Can I use this for my own organization?

**Short answer:** Yes! It was originally developed for the River City Housing Cooperative in Iowa City but may be adapted by other cooperatives as well. Everything you need is available for free and it should be pretty low-maintenance after the initial configuration (which I've included instructions for). I'm also happy to answer questions or even set everything up for you (for a small fee).

**Long answer:** Yes...but you should also be aware of some caveats:
* There are some security issues that, with some careful configuration, can largely be mitigated, but not solved entirely. Please be mindful of the warnings when completing the setup process and don't hesistate to contact me if you have questions or concerns about security.
* While Airtable is free to sign up for, there are limitations to how many records (survey submissions) can be stored before you need to upgrade to a paid account. This may or may not be a concern depending on how large your cooperative is. My workaround for this is the "archive.html" page, which provides steps for backing up existing records and condensing them down. You can visit https://airtable.com/pricing to get a better idea of what the limits are.

Obviously, I made a lot of difficult choices to develop this solution for tracking work credit at no cost (other than my own work credit time) and without major sacrifices in ease of use or maintenance. It's far from perfect, but the RCHC community has really appreciated the work I've put into this system and I would love for it to benefit other communities!

## I understand. I still want to use it!

Great! This code is provided under the MIT license, which means you're able to use it, for free, with the understanding that I provide no warranty or anything (though you're welcome to contact me for help, within reason). While there is some configuration involved before it can be used, it should mostly "just work" from that point forward with little to no maintenance required. You can find setup instructions [here](SETUP.md).

## I'm not tech-savvy! Can you help me set this up?

Sure! If you would like to use this system but aren't comfortable dealing with the setup process, feel free to shoot an email to [contact@izzyneuha.us](mailto:contact@izzyneuha.us). Like I said, I'm happy to field questions about the setup process or provide clarifications. I can even handle the whole process myself if you don't mind paying a small fee for my time.

## Anything else I should know?

I'm always looking to improve the system, so if you have feedback or feature requests, please let me know!
